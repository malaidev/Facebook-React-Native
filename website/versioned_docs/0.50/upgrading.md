Upgrading requires a small amount of effort, but we try to make it easy for you. The instructions are a bit different depending on whether you used <code>create-react-native-app</code> or <code>react-native init</code> to create your project.</p><h2><a class="anchor" name="create-react-native-app-projects"></a>Create React Native App projects <a class="hash-link" href="docs/upgrading.html#create-react-native-app-projects">#</a></h2><p>Upgrading your Create React Native App project to a new version of React Native requires updating the <code>react-native</code>, <code>react</code>, and <code>expo</code> package versions in your <code>package.json</code> file. Please refer to <a href="https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app/blob/master/VERSIONS.md" target="_blank">this document</a> to find out what versions are supported. You will also need to set the correct <code>sdkVersion</code> in your <code>app.json</code> file.</p><p>See the <a href="https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app/blob/master/react-native-scripts/template/README.md#updating-to-new-releases" target="_blank">CRNA user guide</a> for up-to-date information about upgrading your project.</p><h2><a class="anchor" name="projects-built-with-native-code"></a>Projects built with native code <a class="hash-link" href="docs/upgrading.html#projects-built-with-native-code">#</a></h2><span><div class="banner-crna-ejected">

    This section only applies to projects made with <code>react-native init</code> or to those made with Create React Native App which have since ejected.

</span><p>Because React Native projects built with native code are essentially made up of an Android project, an iOS project, and a JavaScript project, upgrading can be rather tricky. Here's what you need to do to upgrade from an older version of React Native.</p><h3><a class="anchor" name="upgrade-based-on-git"></a>Upgrade based on Git <a class="hash-link" href="docs/upgrading.html#upgrade-based-on-git">#</a></h3><p>The module <code>react-native-git-upgrade</code> provides a one-step operation to upgrade the source files with a minimum of conflicts. Under the hood, it consists in 2 phases:</p><ul><li>First, it computes a Git patch between both old and new template files,</li><li>Then, the patch is applied on the user's sources.</li></ul><blockquote><p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> You don't have to install the new version of the <code>react-native</code> package, it will be installed automatically.</p></blockquote><h4><a class="anchor" name="1-install-git"></a>1. Install Git <a class="hash-link" href="docs/upgrading.html#1-install-git">#</a></h4><p>While your project does not have to be handled by the Git versioning system -- you can use Mercurial, SVN, or nothing -- you will still need to <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads" target="_blank">install Git</a> on your system in order to use <code>react-native-git-upgrade</code>. Git will also need to be available in the <code>PATH</code>.</p><h4><a class="anchor" name="2-install-the-react-native-git-upgrade-module"></a>2. Install the <code>react-native-git-upgrade</code> module <a class="hash-link" href="docs/upgrading.html#2-install-the-react-native-git-upgrade-module">#</a></h4><p>The <code>react-native-git-upgrade</code> module provides a CLI and must be installed globally:</p><div class="prism language-sh">$ npm install <span class="token operator">-</span>g react<span class="token operator">-</span>native<span class="token operator">-</span>git<span class="token operator">-</span>upgrade</div><h4><a class="anchor" name="3-run-the-command"></a>3. Run the command <a class="hash-link" href="docs/upgrading.html#3-run-the-command">#</a></h4><p>Run the following command to start the process of upgrading to the latest version:</p><div class="prism language-sh">$ react<span class="token operator">-</span>native<span class="token operator">-</span>git<span class="token operator">-</span>upgrade</div><blockquote><p>You may specify a React Native version by passing an argument: <code>react-native-git-upgrade X.Y</code></p></blockquote><p>The templates are upgraded in a optimized way. You still may encounter conflicts but only where the Git 3-way merge have failed, depending on the version and how you modified your sources.</p><h4><a class="anchor" name="4-resolve-the-conflicts"></a>4. Resolve the conflicts <a class="hash-link" href="docs/upgrading.html#4-resolve-the-conflicts">#</a></h4><p>Conflicted files include delimiters which make very clear where the changes come from.
