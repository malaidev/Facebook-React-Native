<a id="content"></a><h1><a class="anchor" name="upgrading"></a>Upgrading <a class="hash-link" href="docs/upgrading.html#upgrading">#</a></h1><div><p>Upgrading to new versions of React Native will give you access to more APIs, views, developer tools
and other goodies. Because React Native projects are essentially made up of an Android project, an
iOS project and a JavaScript project, all combined under an npm package, upgrading can be rather
tricky. But we try to make it easy for you. Here's what you need to do to upgrade from an older
version of React Native:</p><h2><a class="anchor" name="1-upgrade-the-react-native-dependency"></a>1. Upgrade the <code>react-native</code> dependency <a class="hash-link" href="docs/upgrading.html#1-upgrade-the-react-native-dependency">#</a></h2><p>Note the latest version of the <code>react-native</code> npm package from here (or use <code>npm info react-native</code> to check):</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native">https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native</a></li></ul><p>Now install that version of <code>react-native</code> in your project with <code>npm install --save</code>.</p><div class="prism language-javascript">$ npm install <span class="token operator">--</span>save react<span class="token operator">-</span>native@X<span class="token punctuation">.</span>Y 
# where X<span class="token punctuation">.</span>Y is the semantic version you are upgrading to</div><h2><a class="anchor" name="2-upgrade-your-project-templates"></a>2. Upgrade your project templates <a class="hash-link" href="docs/upgrading.html#2-upgrade-your-project-templates">#</a></h2><p>The new npm package will likely contain updates to the files that are normally generated when you
run <code>react-native init</code>, like the iOS and the Android sub-projects. To get these latest changes,
run this in a terminal:</p><div class="prism language-javascript">$ react<span class="token operator">-</span>native upgrade</div><p>This will check your files against the latest template and perform the following:</p><ul><li>If there is a new file in the template, it is simply created.</li><li>If a file in the template is identical to your file, it is skipped.</li><li>If a file is different in your project than the template, you will be prompted; you have options
to view a diff between your file and the template file, keep your file or overwrite it with the
template version. If you are unsure, press <code>h</code> to get a list of possible commands.</li></ul><h1><a class="anchor" name="manual-upgrades"></a>Manual Upgrades <a class="hash-link" href="docs/upgrading.html#manual-upgrades">#</a></h1><p>Some upgrades require manual steps, e.g. 0.13 to 0.14, or 0.28 to 0.29. Be sure to check the <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/releases" target="_blank">release notes</a> when upgrading so that you can identify any manual changes your particular project may require.</p></div><div class="docs-prevnext"><a class="docs-prev" href="docs/performance.html#content">← Prev</a><a class="docs-next" href="docs/platform-specific-code.html#content">Next →</a></div><p class="edit-page-block">You can <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/docs/Upgrading.md">edit the content above on GitHub</a> and send us a pull request!</p>
